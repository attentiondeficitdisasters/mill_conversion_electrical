## First things first: I have no idea what I'm doing
### Do Not use anything documented here as a recommendation or suggestion as to how to do a project like this.

#### The .qet file is for https://qelectrotech.org/ which I'm attempting to use to create some schematic documentation. I got the idea from Rotary_SMP's YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/RotarySMP
#### The .xlsx file is the excel spreadsheet I'm using to augment the schematics because it's much faster.
#### There are PDF printouts of both the spreadsheet and QElectrotech file for easier reference
#### There is an electrical schematic provided by DMM, the maker of the servos and servo drives that I'm using, for a 3-axis installation.
